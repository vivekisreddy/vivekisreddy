# About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate and driven student double majoring in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science at 
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I have a deep interest in cutting-edge technologies, particularly in the fields 
of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR), and Autonomous Drones. My work and projects reflect a 
strong commitment to integrating software seamlessly with hardware to create innovative solutions. I thrive on the challenge of 
combining programming, mechanics, and electrical hardware to bring my ideas to life.

## Education
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) - Class of 2026 

Double Major in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science

## Interests

My academic journey and personal projects are driven by my fascination with various areas of technology, including:

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is more than just a buzzword for me. It's a field that continually inspires me. 
I love exploring machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision to create intelligent and autonomous systems.

Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR)

AMR technology has the potential to revolutionize industries.
I'm passionate about designing, programming, and optimizing robots 
that can navigate and perform tasks autonomously.

Autonomous Drones

Drones are not just for aerial photography; they represent a 
fascinating blend of robotics and AI. I enjoy working on drones 
that can fly autonomously, sense their surroundings, and execute complex missions.

Integration of Software within Hardware

The synergy between software and hardware is where the magic happens. 
I find immense satisfaction in creating seamless integration between these two worlds, 
whether it's developing software for embedded systems or optimizing hardware for software performance.


Get in Touch

I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn, and explore the exciting world of technology.
