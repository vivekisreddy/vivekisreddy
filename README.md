# Work Experience 

**Solgud Robotics (Robots-as-a-Service)** - *Harvard University iLabs, Boston*   
**Robotics Engineer â€“ Founding Team Intern** *June - Sept 2023*


- Programmed the robot software using PUDU software and interpreted the hardware-software connection between the robot and   
the computer
- Utilized SLAM technology based on LiDAR Cameras, RGBD, IMU, Encoder and multiple sensors to ensure that the robot   
performs the tasks efficiently in mixed environmental settings
- Understood the use of generative AI within the robot and capturing feedback in which the robot is trained to sense, think, and act   
on a specific agenda


**Department of Computer Science** - *WPI*   
**Office Assistant, CS Website Developer** *Jan 2023 - Present*

- Interpret current WPI CS Website and develop a better version with new features and more interactive website

**Computational Biology & Bioinformatics** - *WPI*   
**Computer Programmer | Research Assistant** *Sept 2022 - Jan 2023*

- Developed plots and graphs using R-Studio and extracted data from Python files, programmed various functions in Python
- Created and ran simulations under the professor to replicate real-life behaviors of cells at the microscopic level


# Interests

My academic journey and personal projects are driven by my fascination with various areas of technology, including:

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is more than just a buzzword for me. It's a field that continually inspires me. 
I love exploring machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision to create intelligent and autonomous systems.

Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR)

AMR technology has the potential to revolutionize industries.
I'm passionate about designing, programming, and optimizing robots 
that can navigate and perform tasks autonomously.

Autonomous Drones

Drones are not just for aerial photography; they represent a 
fascinating blend of robotics and AI. I enjoy working on drones 
that can fly autonomously, sense their surroundings, and execute complex missions.

Integration of Software within Hardware

The synergy between software and hardware is where the magic happens. 
I find immense satisfaction in creating seamless integration between these two worlds, 
whether it's developing software for embedded systems or optimizing hardware for software performance.
